# Here are the detailed steps to apply the Merge Sort algorithm to the array `11 1 30 2 51 6 29 7 67 15 118 4 89 23`

## 1. Step 1: Segmentation

Initial array: `11 1 30 2 51 6 29 7 67 15 118 4 89 23`

Divided into two halves: `11 1 30 2 51 6 and 29 7 67 15 118 4 89 23`

## 2. Step 2: Further segmentation

Left Half Split: `11 1 30 2 51 6` is split into `11 1` and `30 2 51 6`

Split the right half: `29 7 67 15 118 4 89 23` into `29 7 67 15` and `118 4 89 23`

## 3. Step 3: Continue to split

Left half of an array split: `11 1` is split into `11` and `1`

The right half of the left half of the array: `30 2 51 6` is divided into `30 2` and `51 6`

The left half of the right half of the array: `29 7 67 15` is divided into `29 7` and `67 15`

The right half of the right half of the array: `118 4 89 23` is divided into `118 4` and `89 23`

## 4. Step 4: Proceed to the split

Left half split of left half of the left half of the array: `11` and `1` split into `11` and `1` (can no longer be split)

The right half of the left half of the array splits the right: `30 2` is split into `30` and `2`

Left half split of the right half of the left half of the array: `51 6` is split into `51` and `6`

Left half of the right half of the array: `29 7` is divided into `29` and `7`

The right half of the right half of the right half of the array: `67 15` is divided into `67` and `15`

The left half of the right half of the right half of the array: `118 4` is split into `118` and `4`

The right half of the right half of the array splits the right half: `89 23` is split into `89` and `23`

## 5. Step 5: Merge and sort

The left half of the left half of the array merges the right half of the left half: `11` and `1` are combined to `1 11`

The right half of the left half of the left half of the array merges the left half of the right half: `30` and `2` are combined to `2 30`

The left half of the right half of the left half of the array merges the left half of the right half: `51` and `6` are combined to `6 51`

The left half of the left half of the right half of the array merges the right half of the left half: `29` and `7` are combined to `7 29`

The right half of the left half of the right half of the array merges the left half of the right half: `67` and `15` are combined into `15 67`

The left half of the right half of the right half of the array merges the right half of the right half: `118` and `4` are combined to `4 118`

The right half of the right half of the array merges the right half of the right half of the left half of the array: `89` and `23` are combined into `23 89`

## 6. Step 6: Proceed with the merge

Merge the left half of the left half of the array with the right half of the left half: `1 11` and `2 30` are merged into `1 2 11 30`

Merge the left half of the right half of the array with the left half of the right half: `7 29` and `15 67` are merged into `7 15 29 67`

The left half of the right half of the right half of the array: `4 118` and `23 89` are merged into `4 23 89 118`

## 7. Step 7: Proceed with the merge

Merge the left half of the array with the left half of the right half: `1 2 11 30` and `7 15 29 67` are merged into `1 2 7 11 15 29 30 67`

The right half of the right half of the array is merged with the right half of the right half: `4 23 89 118` and `23 89` are merged into `4 23 23 89 89 118` (note: there is a duplication here, indicating an error in the merge process, the correct merge should be `4 23 89 118`)

## 8. Step 8: Final Merge

Merge the entire array: `1 2 7 11 15 29 30 67` and `4 23 89 118` into ` 1 2 4 7 11 15 23 29 30 67 89 118`

## 9. Comparison Table

Sort array '11 1 30 2 51 6 29 7 67 15 118 4 89 23'

### 9.1 Best Case Scenario:

    If the array is already partially sorted, or if we are very lucky enough to choose a benchmark element that happens to split the array in half, then the time complexity of Merge Sort will be O(n log n).
    For example, if our array is 1 2 6 7 11 30 51 29 67 15 118 4 89 23, then Merge Sort will run in the best case scenario because the array is already partially sorted.

### 9.2 Worst Case Scenario:

    If the array is already fully sorted, or we are very unfortunate enough to choose a benchmark element that happens to split the array in half, then the time complexity of Merge Sort will be O(n log n).
    In this case, although the time complexity is still O(n log n), in fact, since the array is already sorted, we can reduce unnecessary work with some optimizations.

Average case: In the average case, the time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n).
This is because, regardless of which element we choose as the baseline, Merge Sort will split the array in half, and the time complexity of the merge operation will be O(n).
